# [SDF09] Project Brief: Blackjack Game on GitHub

In this project, you will dive into creating a Blackjack game, a popular card game, using Scrimba. By the end of this course, you'll have built a fully functional game and deepened your understanding of JavaScript, including arrays, loops, and objects. Additionally, you'll be guided through basic best practices for mini-game development and user experience enhancement.

### Project Requirements

- Setup up your own Starter Code SDF05 Repo
- Code along in VSCode with Scrimba
- Build and customise your version of the Blackjack game.
- Ensure the game operates smoothly and maintains a consistent style.
- Submit your GitHub Repo link of your completed BlackJack Game to the LMS on the SDF05 Project Tab

# My project

This challenge was both interesting and fun, offering a great opportunity to dive deeper into JavaScript. I found JavaScript to be mentally stimulating and exciting as I worked through the logic and syntax. Coding along with the interactive tutorials on Scrimba was incredibly helpful in reinforcing the key concepts. For this project, I added a few unique features to enhance the gameplay experience. These include a reset button to restart the game and a jokers image to add a bit of visual interest. Additionally, I added an overlay effect to the background image with some opacity, making the game’s design more visually appealing.

The game is designed with a maximum bet amount of R200. When the game resets, the player's bet is automatically set back to this maximum value. If the player’s funds are below the minimum bet amount or equal to zero, the game will not start. This ensures that players are always able to place a valid bet and keeps the game logic straightforward.
